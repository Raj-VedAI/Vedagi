  <h2 class="section-title">The Problem We're Solving</h2>
  <div class="problem-statement">
    <p>Healthcare executives make decisions involving millions of dollars and patient outcomes. Financial institutions manage risks that could trigger regulatory penalties. Manufacturers optimize supply chains where errors cascade across entire production lines.</p>
    <p>These leaders can't use generic AI assistants. ChatGPT hallucinates numbers. Claude fabricates calculations. Current AI tools are built for consumer convenience, not enterprise accountability.</p>
    <p><strong>The fundamental problem:</strong> Large language models blend reasoning with calculation, creating AI that sounds confident while being mathematically wrong. This makes them unusable for high-stakes decisions—which is exactly where the enterprise value lives.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="reveal our-solution">
  <h2 class="section-title">Our Solution</h2>
  <div class="solution-content">
    <p class="solution-intro">VedAGI built the first AI architecture that separates calculations from reasoning. We don't let the LLM do math—we generate verified Python code, execute it in isolation, and trace every step.</p>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Zero Hallucinations</h3>
        <p>Hard architectural boundaries prevent fabricated numbers. All calculations happen in sandboxed Python environments with complete audit trails.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Enterprise Trust</h3>
        <p>C-suite executives can verify every calculation, trace every assumption, and stake million-dollar decisions on our intelligence.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Regulatory Ready</h3>
        <p>PIPEDA, SOC 2 Type II, PHIPA compliance built-in. Role-based access, encryption, and governance that meets regulated industry standards.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <h2 class="section-title">Our Vision</h2>
  <div class="vision-statement">
    <p>We're creating a new category: <strong>Strategic AI Advisors</strong> for regulated industries.</p>
    <p>Not chatbots. Not productivity tools. Not generic assistants.</p>
    <p>We're building AI that replaces consulting workflows—delivering in 30 seconds what traditionally takes weeks, with accuracy executives can verify and trust they can defend to boards and regulators.</p>
    <p>Starting with healthcare (ClarityOps), we're expanding across every regulated industry where decision accuracy isn't optional: financial services, manufacturing, energy, pharmaceuticals. Industries where errors cost millions and AI must be right, not just plausible.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Why VedAGI Exists</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card story-card">
      <h3>The Opportunity</h3>
      <p>Enterprises spend $15B+ annually on consultants and fragmented analytics waiting weeks for strategic insights. Meanwhile, AI tools that could deliver instant intelligence are unusable because they hallucinate the numbers that decisions depend on.</p>
      <p>This gap—between what AI could deliver and what executives can trust—is where VedAGI lives.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card story-card">
      <h3>The Founding Insight</h3>
      <p>Traditional AI companies tried to fix hallucinations by making models larger or fine-tuning them endlessly. We realized the architecture itself was broken: you can't trust an LLM to do math any more than you'd trust a creative writer to audit your financials.</p>
      <p>So we built differently. Separate the reasoning from the calculations. Create hard boundaries. Make hallucination architecturally impossible, not just unlikely.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card story-card">
      <h3>The Mission</h3>
      <p>Become the Strategic AI Advisor for every regulated industry where decisions are high-stakes and accuracy isn't negotiable. We're not building another AI feature—we're creating the category that replaces consulting and consolidates fragmented analytics into one trusted platform.</p>
      <p>Category creation. Market leadership. $5-10B exit potential within 7-8 years.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">Our Principles</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="card principle-card">
      <h3>Trust Through Architecture</h3>
      <p>We earn trust by making hallucinations impossible, not improbable. Our architecture creates hard boundaries between reasoning and calculation—executives don't need to "trust the AI," they can verify every number.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card principle-card">
      <h3>Enterprise First</h3>
      <p>We build for decisions involving millions of dollars, patient outcomes, and regulatory compliance. Consumer AI optimizes for engagement; we optimize for accuracy executives can stake their careers on.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card principle-card">
      <h3>Compliance as Foundation</h3>
      <p>Regulatory requirements aren't obstacles—they're moats. PIPEDA, SOC 2, PHIPA, Basel III compliance isn't bolted on, it's built in from day one.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card principle-card">
      <h3>Speed AND Accuracy</h3>
      <p>30-second insights don't compromise on precision. We deliver consulting-grade analysis at AI speed because enterprises need both—fast decisions backed by verifiable intelligence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card principle-card">
      <h3>Category Creation</h3>
      <p>We're not competing with ChatGPT or replacing Excel. We're creating Strategic AI Advisors as a category, becoming the trusted intelligence layer between fragmented data and executive decisions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card principle-card">
      <h3>Hypergrowth Discipline</h3>
      <p>We're venture-backed and building for scale—targeting $550M ARR by Year 7. But hypergrowth without trust is unsustainable. We scale what works, not what's flashy.</p>
