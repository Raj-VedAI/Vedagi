      <h1>Building the World’s First Open, Safe, Human-Aligned AGI</h1>
      <p>Ved AGI is pioneering a new era of intelligence — one that empowers humanity, fosters innovation, and remains transparent at every step.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>Artificial General Intelligence should serve everyone, not just the privileged few. We are committed to creating an AGI that is safe, aligned with human values, and accessible globally.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Now</h2>
      <p>Big Tech abandoned the mission of open, safe AGI. Ved AGI is picking up the ball — building where they stopped, and raising the standard for transparency and collaboration.</p>
